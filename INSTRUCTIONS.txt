2018-12-01 Directions to use make_concentration_graphs.py

Python libraries that you need to have installed:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scipy

If you use the Anaconda Python, you may just be able to type "conda install pandas" to install the packages automatically.
If you use another Python installation and have pip3 installed, you can type "pip3 install pandas" to install the packages automatically.
__________________________________________________________

Open Terminal

cd to directory with make_concentration_graphs.py

run this:

	python3 ./make_concentration_graphs.py [input]

where [input] is:

REQUIRED:
	path_to_folder_with_metadata_and_summary_file (e.g. /Users/jon/analysis/SMAD_experiment)

	IMPORTANT: Folder must contain 2 excel files:
			1. Metadata file that specifies samples, plot groups, and colors. It is important that the image_name rows
			   match the order of the rows in the summary file (2) because I do not do any search and just assume the 
			   rows are the same. Must have 'metadata' in the Excel file name. 
				plot_group is a number where all samples with same plot_group will go together on same plot. 
				color is a code that corresponds to the color and marker type. 
				Available colors are: b, g, r, c, m, y, k, w corresponding to blue, green, red, cyan, magenta, yellow, black, white
				Available markers are here: <https://matplotlib.org/api/markers_api.html#module-matplotlib.markers>  
				(e.g. bo is blue circle; g. is green point)

			2. Summary data file that contains the partition ratio, condensed fraction, or total intensity data for each set of images. Must have 'summary' in Excel file name

OPTIONAL:

--o : Output directory name to use. Default is the name of the metadata folder with "_output" added to the end. In both cases, the output directory will be stored in the same directory where the metadata and summary file are stored.

--i : column name to use from summary file to plot. Defaults to Partition_ratio_mean_488
	IMPORTANT: If you use --i, you must also use --s
--s : column name to use from summary file for standard deviation to plot. Defaults to Partition_ratio_std488
	IMPORTANT: If you use --s, you must also use --i

--l : label for x-axis. Defaults to [protein] (ÂµM)

--p : parameters for exponential fit. Write --p a b c. Defaults to 1.0 0.001 1000

--no-threshold : Flag that includes all raw data. If you don't provide --no-threshold, then all values less than 1 will be set to zero (Default behavior). This is the case where partition ratios less than 1 are meaningless.

--no-fit : Flag that does not include or do exponential curve fitting. You may want to set this if you don't want the exponential curve to be plotted.


______________TEST___________________

To make sure pipeline is working:

Open Terminal

cd to directory with make_concentration_graphs.py
python3 ./make_concentration_graphs.py ./test_SMAD3 --o test_results --l [SMAD3]

OR

python3 /full_path_on_your_computer/make_concentration_graphs.py /full_path_on_your_computer/test_SMAD3 --o test_results --l [SMAD3]
